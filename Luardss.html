             <br>Rain gently falls whenever we say "goodnight"
        <br>Falling like when you're out of sight
        <br>Rain follows me even in my bed
        <br>And rain is the tears that I shed
        <br>There'll be no sunshine in my life
        <br>Until you say you're mine, oh, mine
        <br>There'll be no summer, spring or fall
        <br>Each day is like winter time
        <br>But I can never say I care
        <br>I know it won't be smart
        <br>Somebody owns your heart
        <br>It can never be mine
        <br>So it rains when you're near, knowing we can't even touch
        <br>Rain knows that I love you so much
        <br>But I know that my love will only cause you pain
        <br>So I'd rather live with the rain
        <br>There'll be no sunshine in my life
        <br>Until you say you're mine, oh, mine
        <br>There'll be no summer, spring or fall
        <br>Each day is like winter time
        <br>But I can never say I care
        <br>I know it won't be smart
        <br>Somebody owns your heart
        <br>It can never be mine
        <br>Rain gently falls whenever we say "goodnight"
        <br>Falling like when you're out of sight
        <br>Rain follows me even in my bed
        <br>And rain is the tears that I shed
        <br>There'll be no sunshine in my life

        <br>But I can never say I care
        <br>I know it won't be smart
        <br>Somebody owns your heart
        <br>It can never be mine
        <br>Whoa, whoa, whoa
        <br>It can never be mine
