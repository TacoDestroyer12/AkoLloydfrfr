<h3>
<br>Rain gently falls whenever we say "goodnight"
<br>Falling like when you're out of sight
<br>Rain follows me even in my bed
<br>And rain is the tears that I shed
<br>There'll be no sunshine in my life
<br>Until you say you're mine, oh, mine
<br>There'll be no summer, spring or fall
<br>Each day is like winter time
<br>But I can never say I care
<br>I know it won't be smart
<br>Somebody owns your heart
<br>It can never be mine
<br>So it rains when you're near, knowing we can't even touch
<br>Rain knows that I love you so much
<br>But I know that my love will only cause you pain
<br>So I'd rather live with the rain
<br>There'll be no sunshine in my life
<br>Until you say you're mine, oh, mine
<br>There'll be no summer, spring or fall
<br>Each day is like winter time
<br>But I can never say I care
<br>I know it won't be smart
<br>Somebody owns your heart
<br>It can never be mine
<br>Rain gently falls whenever we say "goodnight"
<br>Falling like when you're out of sight
<br>Rain follows me even in my bed
<br>And rain is the tears that I shed
<br>There'll be no sunshine in my life
<br>Until you say you're mine, oh, mine
<br>There'll be no summer, spring or fall
<br>Each day is like winter time
<br>But I can never say I care
<br>I know it won't be smart
<br>Somebody owns your heart
<br>It can never be mine
<br>Whoa, whoa, whoa
<br>It can never be mine
